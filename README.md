This is a flutter tool library. This library is for personal use and is less customizable. Prefer a small amount of code to implement functions, rather than a large and comprehensive tool library. So not suitable for all projects. This library contains two parts: **foundation** and **widget**

## Usage
To use this plugin, add je_kit as a dependency in your pubspec.yaml file.

## Foundation
Some foundation tools

## Widget
Some common widgets
